 # print has 5 parameters

 # object --->the value to be printed is object
 #sep---> seperator
 # Eg
 # a = 8
 # b = 9
 # c = 89
 # print (a,b,c sep='$')

 # end ---> which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
 # # It will not keep the command to stay in same line
 # Eg
 # print(str(a), b, end='%%')
 # print(str(c))

  # print(a,b)
  # print  (a)
  # print  (b)

  #a=7
  #b=7

  #a = b = 7
  #print(a,b)

  # a=8, 7, 9.89, "hello"
  # print(a)
  # print(type(a))

  # a, b = 78 #error
